# System Architecture

This system architecture consists of the following components:

* **Client Applications**: The client-side applications that interact with the system.
* **API Gateway**: The entry point for client applications, responsible for routing requests to the appropriate services.
* **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
* **Messaging Service**: Responsible for sending and receiving messages between users.
* **Channel Service**: Manages channels for messaging and other purposes.
* **User  Service**: Handles user-related data and operations.
* **File Storage Service**: Provides storage for files and other media.
* **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users.
* **Database**: The central database for storing system data.
* **Search Service**: Provides search functionality for the system.
* **Integration Service**: Handles integrations with external systems and services.

The system architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, with each service communicating with the API Gateway to provide a unified interface for client applications.

## Diagram

The system architecture is visualized in the following diagram:
```

```
This diagram shows the high-level architecture of the system, with the client applications interacting with the API Gateway, which in turn interacts with the various services.
