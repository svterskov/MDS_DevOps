5. **Channel Service**: Manages channels and conversations.
6. **User Service**: Manages user profiles and presence.
7. **File Storage Service**: Handles file uploads, storage, and retrieval.
8. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users.
9. **Database**: Stores user data, messages, and channel information.
10. **Search Service**: Enables searching through messages and files.
11. **Integration Service**: Manages third-party integrations and bots.
